      <p>In A Wild Sheep Chase, Murakami blends elements of American literature with Japanese contexts, exploring post World War II Japanese cultural identity.  The book is part mystery and part fantasy with a post moder twist.  A surreal and elaborate quest that takes our hero from Tokyo to the remote and snowy mountains of northern Japan, where he confronts not only the mythological sheep, but the confines of tradition and the demons deep within himself.  Quirky and utterly captivating, A Wild Sheep Chase is Murakami at his astounding best. <br>- NY Press</p>

      <p>"A Wild Sheep Chase" by Haruki Murakami is a bold new advance in a category of international fiction that could be called the trans-Pacific novel.  Youthful, slangy, political and allegorical, Mr. Murakami is a writer who seems to be aware of every current American novel and popular song.  Yet with its urban setting, yuppie characters and subtle feeling of mystery, even menace, his novel is clearly rooted in modern Japan.  On the surface, "A Wild Sheep Chase" is just that: a mystery story with a long chase.  A photograph of the wild sheep has appeared accidentally in a newsletter; like Dashiell Hammett's Maltese falcon, the singular sheep is pursued by clashing interests.  Is the sheep a symbol of something beyond the reach of an ordinary man, a devilish temptation?  Does this wild sheep represent heroic morality or a Nietzschean superpower?  Nietzsche is mentioned in the novel; so is the obsessive quest for Moby-Dick.  The answer, if any, is left to the reader's perception.<br>- New York Times</p>
